How to reduce uWSGI memory
uwsgi, python, memory, django, server

    cheap = true
    idle = 10
    lazy-apps = true
    processes = 1
    ksm = 10

some extra things to make ksm work.

    echo 1 > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run

I'm not sure what happens at a restart, the above might get wiped.

if `/sys/kernel/mm/ksm/pages_shared` and/or `/sys/kernel/mm/ksm/pages_sharing` don't say `0` ksm is working

more ksm info here http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/KSM.html
