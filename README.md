hows
====

I've wanted an easy way to document tid-bits that I discover while doing technology work, or maybe even life in general, but never had a good way to do this. Sometimes I did this with my blog but it never worked too well. But I have a plan.

In this folder, there will exist several text files, one for each how to. The file name does not matter. This file will follow the format:
```
-- start of file --  
1  
Here is my title  
tag1, tag2, tag3, tag 4, my tag5  
  
  
the text of the how in markdown  
-- end of the file --
```
The file starts off with a "1" this represents the version number of my "how standard/template" this exists just to enable to ability to change the template in the future, or have multiple. Next is the title, the tile can be anything, but cannot contain line breaks. The title will probabably ultimately be a web link in the future. Then there are tags, the tags are comma delimited and must not have line breaks. Then there are two line breaks, and then text which will be in markdown. And that is it!

One day, when I find a "time tree" I will create something that parses these how files and creates a nice web page.

There is a possibility that later I will want to be able to attach assets to these how files. I hope not, but, it might become necessary or useful. I account for this when the time comes. At first thought though, I could have an "assets" folder in the root folder with all the hows, which would then have subfolders labeled the same as the how file. I'm not sure. I will figure this out as I go.
